# Alright if you wanna read all that gibber gabber then scroll down I guess.. Lol
So welcome back to another read me. If you don't want to read me then click off. (joke btw) unless you want to... I won't force you of course! ~~~

Back on topic now welcome back this is my official 2nd README for a project so.. LET'S GO!!!!!

What is this project? So this project was made from the inspiration of another Web Developer - Jordan Jackson (here's her Github: https://github.com/jordanr2m)
She made an awesome project called the Studio Ghibli Film Finder and you can guess where I got the inspiration from. (I guess I did just tell you..)
So yes this project is just a database of (almost) all of the Gainax animations and the reason it's not all is because it turned out to be a pain finding all of their actual films and (ChatGPT is sometimes an unreliable demon that I want to cancel my subscription on)

I started this project last Tuesday but got a massive sickness from Wendsday-Sunday but I thankfully powered through and finished it at 12 am in the morning (Currently 1:55 am while writing this) oh and for people who don't know the day it's officially Wednesday but the project was mainly done yesterday which was Tuesday. Confusing I know.

But yeah this app has lots of features like 3 filter bars to find the movie you want to watch, responsive for mobile so you can find them on your phone. And I may add a favorites command to but I currently don't feel like doing all that.

# So yeah that's pretty much the 4-day project push to git this out. I suffered quite a bit of spoilers trying to make this SO PLEASE TRY IT OUT :)


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
